Personal Project - implementation of a Trie in C, where all words use lowercase letters.

Implementing the functions: Insert, Remove, Search, trieStartsWith.
Managing memory allocation and free as well.


Note: I assumed all words are shorter than 2000 characters and therefore can be indexed with a "short" and not an "int".
